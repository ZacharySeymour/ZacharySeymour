# Hello!! 

## About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZacharySeymour, an early career analyst trying to transition into Data Scientist. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Management from Tulane University in 2020 and recently graduated from MIT's Applied Data Science Program. 
- 👀 I’m interested in working on new Python and SQL projects to increase my knowledgebase.
- 🌱 I’m currently using my recent professional certificate from MIT to explore various data science projects including Predictive Analysis, Recommendation Systems, and Classification Models. I am fascinated by data science and the various brances, and am exploring new concepts to expand my portfolio. I love Python, and have continued to increase my knoledgebase as I learn new tools and libraries. 
- 💞️ Although exploring tech is a main hobby of mine, I also enjoy additional hobbies. My hobbies include reading, working out, video games, and streaming on Twitch. I also love Photography and hope to get back into editing and posting pictures from my adventures.
